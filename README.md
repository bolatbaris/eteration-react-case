# Eteration Frontend Developer Case Study

This project was developed as part of a case study for a Frontend Developer position at Eteration. It showcases my ability to build a modern web application using **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**. The project demonstrates essential frontend skills such as state management, routing, responsive design, and unit testing.

You can test the live version of the project here: [Project Demo](https://eteration-react-case.vercel.app/)


## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bolatbaris/eteration-react-case.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd eteration-react-case
    ```

3. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

4. Start the development server with Vite:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5173/
    ```


   ## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing better tooling and error detection.
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool optimized for modern web projects.
- **MUI (Material UI)**: UI library used to build responsive and consistent design components.
- **React Router Dom v6**: Library for handling routing in React applications.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests.
- **React Query**: Data-fetching library used to manage server state and caching.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management library used for handling global state.
  - **Zustand Persist**: Used for persisting cart and other application states in localStorage, ensuring data remains available across browser sessions.
- **use-debounce**: Utilized for debouncing search input during user typing.
- **ESLint, Prettier, Husky**: Tools to ensure consistent code quality and formatting.


## Unit Testing

Unit tests have been written for the stores to ensure their functionality and reliability. These tests validate that the state management using Zustand works as expected.
